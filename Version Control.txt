Version Control Education & Best Practices
By Datacamp
Keeping track of changes to a project is important to answer comments & supporting info for reviewers, editors, and readers
Software, such as Git, tracks changes (what, when and who) and synchronize to a central location
Best PracticesRecommendations
1.	Back up (almost) everything created by a human as soon as it is created
2.	Keep changes small to be able to investigate specific changes in a version
a.	Rule of thumb group changes you could imagine wanting to undo in one step
3.	Share changes frequently
4.	Create, maintain, and use a checklist for saving and sharing changes to a project
a.	Write log messages that explain any changes, size and content of individual changes, style guidelines for code, update to-do lists, and bans on committing half-done workbroken code
5.	Store each project in a folder that is mirrored off the working machine
a.	Use a system such as Dropbox or a remote repository such as GitHub
Approach 1 Manual Versioning
•	Create a file title “CHANGELOG.txt” under a documentation folder to make dated notes about changes to the project
•	Make copies of projects into folders that are date-titled whenever a significant change is made
•	Have to coordinate so only one person is working on project at a time
Approach 2 Version Control Systems
•	Requires less self-discipline as it automates some steps
•	What to putnot put in Version Control Systems
o	File comparison is optimized for plain text (i.e. source code)
o	Raw data shouldn’t change, therefore no version control needed
o	Results should be able to be generated from software
?	Can be kept if small and want to compare across versions
o	Benchmark for size limit is around 100 MB
o	Watch for sharing sensitive data
